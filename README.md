# WindowsPersistence
This project combines many Windows Persistence techniques and aims to make it impossible for the user to prevent the binary from running. This is intended for use in cybersecurity competitions where root access is held. It is currently a work in progress, more documentation will be added as features are fleshed out and tested.
